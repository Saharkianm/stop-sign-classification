Stop Sign Detection | Binary classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch to predict if an image contains a stopÂ signÂ orÂ not. 

# ðŸš¦ Stop Sign Detection using CNN and PyTorch  

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting stop signs in images. Using PyTorch, the model classifies images into two categories: Stop Sign and No Stop Sign.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview  
We use a CNN-based architecture to train the model on a dataset of images containing stop signs and other road signs. The model learns to distinguish between images with a stop sign and those without.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- PyTorch (for deep learning)  
- NumPy and OpenCV (for image processing)  
- Matplotlib (for visualizing training)  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
This model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of stop signs and non-stop signs. If you want to use your own dataset, ensure it follows the same structure:  
- stop/ - images of stop signs  
- not_stop/ - images without stop signs
